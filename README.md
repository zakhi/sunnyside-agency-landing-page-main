## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Steps

My first step was to create a mobile design, and then use a media query to adapt to desktop.

After that, I tried to accomplish two things:
1. Improve the organization of the CSS
2. Make the design truly responsive, adapting to different resolutions.

### Continued development

* I want to do a fully responsive design from the start.
* Uae Sass mainly for code organization.
